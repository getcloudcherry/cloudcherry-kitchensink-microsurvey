        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Cloudcherry provides its clients the opportunity to reach out to its customers over 17 different channels. Microsurvey
          is a channel used to reach out to customers to get feedback on the website when they are browsing through a section
          on the site. Javascript is generated at CloudCherry which can be embedded on website to make the Microsurvey to
          appear on the website at the right time to the customers. The Microsurvey pop out can be controlled by the client.
          This document is intended to explain how to deploy Microsurvey and collect feedbacks from customers through website.

        <h3>Microsurvey </h3>
        <p>Microsurveys are context specific surveys that are asked at very specific instances of an experience on the website.
          These are generally very short (2 to 3 questions) and uber context specific in nature.
        </p>
        <p>When a customer is browsing a web page, we can configure Microsurvey to appear on the page based on specific scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>The scenarios could be as simple as a customer browsing the product page for more than 120 seconds and browsed scroll
          page is more than 70%. Then as a brand, its ideal to engage the customer and ask what he/she is looking for or
          if there are any concerns causing a delay in taking an action. Another example could be a customer on a newly launched
          product page and exploring the product by clicking on 2 or 3 images. Here itâ€™s ideal for the brand to engage with
          the customer and understand what the customer feels about the website itself and if there are any specific product
          requirements delaying a decision. </p>
